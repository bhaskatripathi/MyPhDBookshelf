# Mathematics: The Creative Activity

## Summary
The book reveals that mathematics is not just a body of formalized rules and results, but a profoundly creative activity. 
The book argues that nonlogical qualities play an essential role in mathematics. It discusses how ambiguities, contradictions, and paradoxes can arise when ideas developed in different contexts come into contact. These uncertainties and conflicts do not impede but rather spur the development of mathematics. 
Byers emphasizes that ambiguity is always present in mathematical thinking, from the most elementary to the most advanced level. He argues that ambiguity, which can mean a single situation or idea perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference, is often the key to growth and discovery in mathematics. 
The book also explores the implications of this creative dimension of mathematical work for our notions of mathematical and scientific truth. It provides a novel approach to many fundamental questions, such as whether mathematics is objectively true, whether it is discovered or invented, and whether there is such a thing as a ‘final’ scientific theory. 

## Notes Summary
1.	Mathematics is not just a set of formalized rules and results, but a profoundly creative activity. 
2.	Nonlogical qualities play an essential role in mathematics. 
3.	Mathematicians often describe their most important breakthroughs as creative, intuitive responses to ambiguity, contradiction, and paradox. 
4.	Ambiguities, contradictions, and paradoxes can arise when ideas developed in different contexts come into contact. 
5.	Uncertainties and conflicts do not impede but rather spur the development of mathematics. 
6.	Creativity often means bringing apparently incompatible perspectives together as complementary aspects of a new, more subtle theory. 
7.	The secret of mathematics is not to be found only in its logical structure. 
8.	The creative dimensions of mathematical work have great implications for our notions of mathematical and scientific truth. 
9.	The book provides a novel approach to many fundamental questions such as: Is mathematics objectively true? Is it discovered or invented? And is there such a thing as a “final” scientific theory?. 
10.	The book reveals that ambiguity is always present, from the most elementary to the most advanced level. 
11.	In teaching school mathematics, ambiguity is an unacknowledged source of difficulty. 
12.	At the level of research, ambiguity is often the key to growth and discovery. 
13.	Ambiguity can mean vagueness, but also, it can mean a single situation or idea that is perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference. 
14.	The power of ideas reside in their ambiguity. 
15.	Any project that would eliminate ambiguity from mathematics would destroy mathematics. 
16.	Familiar examples of ambiguity include negating Euclid’s parallel postulate. 
17.	Different sizes of infinite sets is another example of ambiguity. 
18.	The book is a radically new account of mathematical discourse and mathematical thinking. 
19.	It’s addressed to everyone, from a lay reader who hasn’t met complex numbers, up to a professional who appreciates Sarkovsky’s theorem on cycles of iterated functions, or Goodstein’s number-theoretic equivalent of Gödel’s theorem for arithmetic with induction. 
20.	The book faces deep contemporary issues with no hesitancy. 
21.	Mathematical thinking and discourse is supposed to be precise, that is to say, unambiguous.
22.	A mathematical statement is supposed to have a single definite meaning.
23.	Ambiguity is always present, from the most elementary to the most advanced level.
24.	In teaching school mathematics, ambiguity is an unacknowledged source of difficulty.
25.	At the level of research, ambiguity is often the key to growth and discovery.
26.	Ambiguity can just mean vagueness. But also, it can mean, as Byers puts it, “a single situation or idea that is perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference”.
27.	In fact, he makes a persuasive case that ambiguity is actually what makes mathematical ideas so powerful.
28.	Normally ambiguity in science and mathematics is seen as something to overcome, something that is due to an error in understanding and is removed by correcting that error.
29.	The ambiguity is rarely seen as having value in its own right, and the existence of ambiguity was often the very thing that spurred a particular development of mathematics and science.
30.	The power of ideas reside in their ambiguity.
31.	Thus any project that would eliminate ambiguity from mathematics would destroy mathematics.
32.	Familiar examples of ambiguity include: Negating Euclid’s parallel postulate.
33.	Different sizes of infinite sets is another example of ambiguity.
34.	The book is a radically new account of mathematical discourse and mathematical thinking.
35.	It’s addressed to everyone, from a lay reader who hasn’t met complex numbers, up to a professional who appreciates Sarkovsky’s theorem on cycles of iterated functions, or Goodstein’s number-theoretic equivalent of Gödel’s theorem for arithmetic with induction.
36.	No math preparation is presupposed, and everything is explained with complete clarity, yet deep contemporary issues are faced with no hesitancy.
37.	The discussion is free of pretentiousness or grandiosity.
38.	Byers straightforwardly explains the issues and clarifies them.
39.	Starting with Imre Lakatos’ 1976 Proofs and Refutations, some writers have been turning away from the search for a “foundation” for mathematics and instead, seeking to understand and clarify the actual practice of mathematics—what real mathematicians really do.
