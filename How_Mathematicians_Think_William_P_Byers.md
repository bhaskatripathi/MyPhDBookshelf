# How Mathematicians Think Paperback by William Byers
URL : https://www.amazon.in/How-Mathematicians-Think-Contradiction-Mathematics/dp/0691145997

## Summary
The book reveals that mathematics is not just a body of formalized rules and results, but a profoundly creative activity. 
The book argues that nonlogical qualities play an essential role in mathematics. It discusses how ambiguities, contradictions, and paradoxes can arise when ideas developed in different contexts come into contact. These uncertainties and conflicts do not impede but rather spur the development of mathematics. 
Byers emphasizes that ambiguity is always present in mathematical thinking, from the most elementary to the most advanced level. He argues that ambiguity, which can mean a single situation or idea perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference, is often the key to growth and discovery in mathematics. 
The book also explores the implications of this creative dimension of mathematical work for our notions of mathematical and scientific truth. It provides a novel approach to many fundamental questions, such as whether mathematics is objectively true, whether it is discovered or invented, and whether there is such a thing as a ‘final’ scientific theory. 

## Notes Summary
1.	Mathematics is not just a set of formal rules and results, but a profoundly creative human activity involving intuition, ambiguity, contradictions, and bringing together of incompatible perspectives.
2.	Nonlogical, creative qualities play an essential role in mathematics. Mathematicians describe breakthroughs as creative responses to ambiguity and paradox.
3.	Ambiguities, contradictions, and paradoxes arise when ideas from different contexts interact. Rather than impeding progress, these uncertainties spur the development of mathematics.
4.	Ambiguity is always present in mathematical thinking, from basic to advanced levels. In research, it is often the key to new discoveries, while in teaching it causes difficulties.
5.	Ambiguity can mean vagueness, but also a single situation perceived in two incompatible yet self-consistent frames of reference. The power of mathematical ideas resides in this creative ambiguity.
6.	The book challenges conceptions of mathematical and scientific truth, asking whether math is objectively true, discovered or invented, and whether there can be a "final" scientific theory.
7.	It provides a new perspective on the practice of mathematics and mathematical discourse, accessible to readers with little to advanced mathematical background.
8.	The book faces issues like the role of ambiguity directly instead of avoiding or downplaying them. It aims to clarify and explain, not pretend there are no uncertainties.
9.	Ambiguity is present across all levels of mathematics - from elementary mathematics taught in schools to cutting edge research mathematics. The book explores the different roles ambiguity plays across these contexts.
10.	In elementary and secondary school mathematics, ambiguity in concepts, definitions, or problems is often an "unacknowledged source of difficulty" for students. Rather than recognizing the creative potential of ambiguity, the standard approach is to eliminate ambiguity and emphasize precision.
11.	However, the book argues that at advanced levels of research, ambiguity, contradictions, and paradoxes between developing ideas are the "key to growth and discovery" rather than obstacles to be eliminated.
12.	Creative breakthroughs in mathematics often involve bringing together clashing perspectives or theories into a new, more subtle synthesis that encompasses both viewpoints. Ambiguity and tension between frameworks spur this creativity.
13.	The book suggests the "secret" of mathematics is not just in its logical deductions, but in this "profoundly creative activity" driven by non-logical qualities like ambiguity, intuition, etc.
15.	Any project that would eliminate ambiguity from mathematics would destroy mathematics. 
16.	Familiar examples of ambiguity include negating Euclid’s parallel postulate. 
17.	Different sizes of infinite sets is another example of ambiguity. 
18.	The book is a radically new account of mathematical discourse and mathematical thinking. 
19.	It’s addressed to everyone, from a lay reader who hasn’t met complex numbers, up to a professional who appreciates Sarkovsky’s theorem on cycles of iterated functions, or Goodstein’s number-theoretic equivalent of Gödel’s theorem for arithmetic with induction. 
20.	The book faces deep contemporary issues with no hesitancy. 
21.	Mathematical thinking and discourse is supposed to be precise, that is to say, unambiguous.
22.	A mathematical statement is supposed to have a single definite meaning.
23.	Ambiguity is always present, from the most elementary to the most advanced level.
24.	In teaching school mathematics, ambiguity is an unacknowledged source of difficulty.
25.	At the level of research, ambiguity is often the key to growth and discovery.
26.	Ambiguity can just mean vagueness. But also, it can mean, as Byers puts it, “a single situation or idea that is perceived in two self-consistent but mutually incompatible frames of reference”.
27.	In fact, he makes a persuasive case that ambiguity is actually what makes mathematical ideas so powerful.
28.	Normally ambiguity in science and mathematics is seen as something to overcome, something that is due to an error in understanding and is removed by correcting that error.
29.	The ambiguity is rarely seen as having value in its own right, and the existence of ambiguity was often the very thing that spurred a particular development of mathematics and science.
30.	The power of ideas reside in their ambiguity.
31.	Thus any project that would eliminate ambiguity from mathematics would destroy mathematics.
32.	Familiar examples of ambiguity include: Negating Euclid’s parallel postulate.
33.	Different sizes of infinite sets is another example of ambiguity.
34.	The book is a radically new account of mathematical discourse and mathematical thinking.
35.	It’s addressed to everyone, from a lay reader who hasn’t met complex numbers, up to a professional who appreciates Sarkovsky’s theorem on cycles of iterated functions, or Goodstein’s number-theoretic equivalent of Gödel’s theorem for arithmetic with induction.
36.	No math preparation is presupposed, and everything is explained with complete clarity, yet deep contemporary issues are faced with no hesitancy.
37.	The discussion is free of pretentiousness or grandiosity.
38.	Byers straightforwardly explains the issues and clarifies them.
39.	Starting with Imre Lakatos’ 1976 Proofs and Refutations, some writers have been turning away from the search for a “foundation” for mathematics and instead, seeking to understand and clarify the actual practice of mathematics—what real mathematicians really do.
